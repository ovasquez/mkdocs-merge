    MkDocs-Merge

    This simple tool allows you to merge the sources of multiple MkDocs sites

    the master site.

    Basic usage: mkdocs-merge run <MASTER_SITE> <SITES>

    MASTER_SITE: Path to the base site in which all other sites will be merged
    into. The mkdocs.yml file of this site will be preserved as is, except for
    the new pages.

    SITES: Paths to the sites to be merged. Each of this sites will be
    converted to a subpage of the master site. Their mkdocs.yml files
    will be ignored except for the pages data.
